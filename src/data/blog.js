One of these projects was the XHP, a PHP language's augmentation made for working with XML files.

What makes him that work-boosting framework is the virtual DOM, which stands for the Document Object Model. Another feature that makes React worth to know is a large society of programmers that use this framework and the content they create for other ones of them - the packages that you can download from the NPM web.

With this language (technically a C# framework) you can build your website backend with the C#, and use React.js for your app's frontend. If you don't know anything about programming in C# and you still want to become a full-stack web developer, nothing lost - the other alternative to this option is Laravel, a PHP language framework.
